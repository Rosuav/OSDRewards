On-Screen Display Rewards
=========================

Stick a browser source into your OBS Studio to have an on-screen display of
custom channel points rewards!

Available on GH Pages: https://rosuav.github.io/OSDRewards/
  - Uses [ComfyJS](https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS) for connectivity
  - Uses [Choc Factory](https://github.com/Rosuav/shed/blob/master/chocfactory.js)
    for rendering
  - Note: Local testing requires a web server (eg `python3 -m http.server`).

TODO:
- If no reward selected, show help info and ask to demo the reward to use
  - Give a direct link that will use that reward
- List people on the page when they redeem a specific reward
- Have a !giveaway command, mod only (streamer only??), to pick one winner
